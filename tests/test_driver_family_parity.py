"""
Guards against legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py and its sibling
rugiar_driver_target.py drifting apart on the logic that is NOT specific to
the "target-aware" family (see both files' module docstrings — they are a
deliberately duplicated pair, one script per task family, rather than a
shared module, because each family is treated as its own architecturally
independent EXPERIMENT).

That duplication is a real maintenance hazard: a bug fix or behavior change
made to a shared helper (e.g. _sibling_meta_simulator, _relaunch_for_family)
in one file is easy to forget to mirror into the other, and nothing else
would catch it.

This test parses (does not import) both files with `ast` and asserts that
every function on the whitelist below — the ones with no target-specific
reason to differ — has textually identical bodies in both files once each
function's own docstring is stripped out (docstrings are allowed to differ,
e.g. to name "this file" vs "the sibling file"; see _script_for_task).
Parsing instead of importing means this test has no Genesis/torch runtime
dependency, unlike most of this project's other rugiar_driver tests.

Deliberately NOT covered here: main()'s body as a whole (it legitimately
differs — the target driver's target-aware obs injection is interleaved into
otherwise-shared control flow) and the shared portions of the module
docstrings themselves. Both files carry a cross-reference comment instead
(see their module docstrings / top-of-file comments) telling a future editor
to mirror non-target changes made inside main() by hand.
