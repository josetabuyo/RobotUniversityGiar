# A task used to be registered here (`G1CautiousCfg`, retired — see
# HANDOFF_task_reward_harmony.md) that only changed 5 reward-scale numbers on top of
# G1RoughCfg's own terms — no new reward term, no obs/action change. Its trained checkpoint
# (logs/g1_cautious/) is untouched and still loadable; only the registered-task path to
# reproduce/continue that config was retired, since a pure reward-weight variant like that
# doesn't need a task class at all: from the Create Policy
# web panel, pick task=g1, clone-from=stable (or any g1 policy), and set overrides in the
# "Reward weights (advanced)" grid for whatever terms you want different — e.g. lower
# tracking_lin_vel for a slower gait, raise dof_acc/dof_vel/action_rate for smoother motion.
# Only write a new `G1...Cfg` class here if the change adds a reward TERM, a termination
# condition, or an obs/action-space change — see HANDOFF_control_web.md §5b.
