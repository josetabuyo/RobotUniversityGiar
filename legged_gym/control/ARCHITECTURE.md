# RUgiar Architecture

## Overview

RobotUniversityGiar (RUgiar) is a Genesis/Isaac-Gym-based fork of `unitree_rl_gym` that covers the full lifecycle of a Unitree humanoid/quadruped policy: training it, transforming it after the fact (fusing or distilling), and then driving a real or simulated robot with it under live operator supervision. The codebase splits along that lifecycle into seven areas. Training produces `policies/<name>/` folders on disk; Policy Operations reads and rewrites those same folders without training; the Robot Driver process (`rugiar_driver.py`) loads policies into a live sim/real loop and exposes a WebSocket control protocol that Control implements and the Web UI (and any other client) speaks; the CLI (`rugiar`) is a thin, side-effect-free frontend onto Training and Policy Operations only, deliberately never touching the live-robot layer. Third-Party Integrations is a placeholder for a motion-capture retargeting pipeline being built in a separate repo. The seven areas are designed to be worked on in parallel — this document exists to make the boundaries between them explicit before that happens.

## The Seven Areas

1. **Training** — launches and tracks PPO training/fine-tuning jobs (local subprocess or Kaggle), owns the policy catalog.
2. **Policy Operations (fuse/distill)** — post-training weight merging and behavior cloning; parallel to Training, not part of it.
3. **Control** — the live-robot engine: policy switching, safety, WebSocket transport, adapters.
4. **Web UI** — the browser client for Control, plus the Training/Fuse/Distill forms.
5. **CLI** — `rugiar` command-line entry point onto Training and Policy Operations only.
6. **Robot Driver** — the process (`rugiar_driver.py` / `rugiar_driver_target.py`) that wires Control, an adapter, and a simulator or real robot together and runs the main loop.
7. **Third-Party Integrations** — placeholder. A collaborator is building human motion-capture retargeting in a separate repo; the plan is for it to eventually feed into RUgiar, most likely as a new panel/data source in the Web UI (e.g. driving a policy or providing reference motion). No integration surface exists yet — treat any code path here as unclaimed until that work lands.

## Area Details

### 1. Training

**Owns:** `legged_gym/control/training.py` (`TrainingManager`, ~1520 lines) — job lifecycle (local subprocess or Kaggle thread), the in-memory `policy_sources` catalog, training-time telemetry/history, system sizing (`system_info`, `estimate`).

**Entry points:**
- `TrainingManager.start(...)` → job_id — launches `web_train.py` (local) or a `KaggleRunner` thread (kaggle).
- `TrainingManager.poll()` — once per sim tick, non-blocking; returns newly finished jobs.
- `TrainingManager.finalize_policy(...)` — copies checkpoint + train_checkpoint.pt + meta.json + train.log into `policies/<name>/`, registers it.
- Catalog/introspection: `discover_local_policies`, `catalog`, `task_defaults`, `policy_info`, `get_policy_order` / `set_policy_order`.
- `start_distillation(...)` and `fuse_policies(...)` also live on `TrainingManager` (see Policy Operations below) — they share job/finalization plumbing with training.

**Talks to:**
- **Robot Driver** (`rugiar_driver.py`) is `TrainingManager`'s primary caller: it calls `start()`, `poll()`, `finalize_policy()` and, on completion, hot-loads the result into the live `PolicySupervisor` — but `training.py` never imports or touches `PolicySupervisor`/`ControlService` itself. That boundary is intentional and load-bearing.
- **Web UI** calls nearly every `TrainingManager` method directly through Control's WebSocket RPC (`training_catalog`, `start_training`, `estimate_training_time`, etc.) — see Control §3.
- **CLI** calls `start()`, `start_distillation()`, `fuse_policies()`, `get_policy_order()`/`set_policy_order()` as pure pass-through, blocking on `poll()` itself instead of a driver loop.
- Spawns `legged_gym/scripts/web_train.py` and `legged_gym/scripts/web_distill.py` as subprocesses; delegates to `legged_gym/control/kaggle_backend.py::KaggleRunner` for the Kaggle backend, `legged_gym/control/fusion.py` and `legged_gym/control/distillation.py` for the actual algorithms.
- Reads/writes `policies/<name>/`, `.policy_order.json`, `logs/_web_training/history.json`.

**Known risk:** `training.py` mixes six concerns in one 1520-line file (job lifecycle, policy catalog, log parsing, system profiling, fusion/distillation orchestration, Kaggle integration) — the single highest merge-conflict-risk file in the repo. See Collaboration Boundaries below.

---

### 2. Policy Operations (fuse/distill)

**Owns:** `legged_gym/control/fusion.py` (weight merging: `merge_state_dicts`, `rebasin_align`, `infer_architecture`) and `legged_gym/control/distillation.py` (behavior cloning: `collect_rollout`, `bc_train`, `check_dimensions_compatible`). Orchestration for both lives in `training.py` (`fuse_policies()` and `start_distillation()`), not here — the algorithms are separated from the job/lifecycle plumbing that drives them.

**Entry points:**
- CLI: `rugiar fuse --policies ... --name ... [--method weighted_average|git_rebasin]`, `rugiar distill --teacher ... --task ... --name ...`.
- RPC (via Control): `ControlService.fuse_policies(...)`, `ControlService.start_distillation(...)`.
- Web UI: "Fuse policies…" and "Distill policy…" panels.

**Two operations, two execution models:**
| | Fusion | Distillation |
|---|---|---|
| Execution | Synchronous, in-process tensor op | Asynchronous subprocess (`web_distill.py`) |
| Requires | `train_checkpoint.pt` on every source (raw rsl_rl state) | Only `checkpoint.pt` on the teacher (any of 5 loadable formats) |
| Hard check | Identical architecture across sources | Matching obs/action dimensions only |
| Duration | Seconds | Minutes, polled like a training job |

**Talks to:**
- **Training** — both operations are literally methods on `TrainingManager` and write to `policies/<name>/` + `register_source()` the same way a training job does; distillation shares `poll()`/`finalize_policy()`.
- **CLI** and **Web UI** call these the same way they call training (see §5, §4).
- Does **not** talk to Control, Robot Driver, or the live sim in any way — outputs are just files a driver may later load.

**Known risk:** `stable` and other externally-sourced policies lack `train_checkpoint.pt` and so can never be fused (only distilled) — this is a hard architectural limitation, not a bug, but is a common newcomer confusion.

---

### 3. Control

**Owns:** the live-robot engine, split into cooperating single-purpose classes:

| Class | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ControlService` | `service.py` | Single public API surface; state flags (paused, restart_requested); glues adapter + supervisor + safety + selector + training together |
| `ControlServer` | `transport.py` | WebSocket `/ws` (FastAPI/uvicorn), thread-safe command queue, status/camera broadcast, MJPEG stream |
| `PolicySupervisor` | `supervisor.py` | Loaded policies, active/pending switch, 15-tick ramp/blend on switch |
| `SafetyGovernor` | `safety.py` | Fall/NaN detection, forces a damping fallback, gates pending switches |
| `Selector` (Protocol) | `selector.py` | Autonomous policy proposal; goes through the same safety gate as a human request |
| `SimAdapter` / `RealAdapter` | `adapter.py` / `deploy/real_adapter.py` | Robot lifecycle (reset, step, manual command, speed limit); `RealAdapter` lives in a separate package so `legged_gym/control/` stays installable without `unitree_sdk2` |
| `Policy` + backends | `policy.py` | Network module + obs_spec; 5 auto-detected checkpoint formats |

**Entry points:** `ControlService` methods, reachable only through `ControlServer`'s WebSocket RPC (30 methods — `request_switch`, `set_command`, `pause`/`resume`/`estop`, `restart`, plus every Training/Policy-Ops method listed above, reflected through here for the Web UI). One exception: `request_switch`, `pause`, `resume`, `estop` may be called directly off the sim thread (cheap flag-sets only, no I/O) — see the concurrency note below before adding anything else to that path.

**Talks to:**
- **Training / Policy Operations** — `ControlService` holds a `TrainingManager` instance and forwards nearly every RPC method to it 1:1; it never reaches into `training.py` internals.
- **Web UI** — the only *built-in* consumer of the WebSocket protocol; all 30 RPC methods exist because the Web UI calls them. Any external client can speak the same protocol — `examples/joystick_controller.py` is a working reference implementation (gamepad or `--demo`) worth checking when changing anything in `transport.py`'s wire format, since it's the cheapest way to sanity-check a protocol change end to end without the Web UI.
- **Robot Driver** — instantiates and owns `ControlService`, `ControlServer`, the adapter, `PolicySupervisor`, `SafetyGovernor`; ticks them once per frame and drains finished training jobs into the supervisor.
- **CLI** — no path at all (see §5's confirmed-boundary section).

**Concurrency model:** two threads — the sim thread (owned by Robot Driver's main loop) and the socket thread (uvicorn's asyncio loop). Commands flow async→sync through a `Queue`, drained once per tick by `drain_commands()`; status/camera flow sync→async through locked snapshots written every tick and read every ~100/80ms. All `ControlService` calls other than the four cheap flag-setters above **must** go through this queue — this is the single most important invariant for anyone touching Control.

---

### 4. Web UI

**Owns:** `web/index.html` (markup, ~1220 lines) and `web/app.js` (all logic, ~3640 lines) — currently one monolithic file with no module boundaries, ~50 module-scope globals, and no build step (by design, as course material).

**Entry points:** none from other areas — this is a leaf. It is driven entirely by `ControlServer`'s WebSocket protocol: `send()` (fire-and-forget) and `call()` (promise-based, matched by message id) wrap every outbound RPC; a `status` broadcast (~10Hz) drives `applyStatus()`, the central render function most panels hook into.

**Panels:** Keyboard, Pause/Restart, Live Telemetry, Camera (stub, hidden unless `--camera`), Command HUDs (WASD + drag + mouse-look, all sharing `cruiseVx/Vy/Yaw` state), Family switch, Policies (list/reorder/rename/delete, shortcut keys), Stress Stimuli, Training (Train/Fuse/Distill forms, ~150 combined DOM refs). A separate "Policy Info Dock" (always visible, not a drawer) shows training curves, provenance, and the training command for the currently-viewed policy.

**Talks to:**
- **Control** exclusively, via the WebSocket protocol described in §3 — this is the *only* channel; there is no other path into the system.
- **Third-Party Integrations** will most likely land here first (see §7) — no code exists yet.

**Known risk:** genuinely the highest same-area collision risk in the repo — everything lives in one global scope with no panel registry, no centralized state object, and no render-function-per-panel convention. Two people adding panels concurrently will very likely collide on global names or on the shared `applyStatus()` render pass. See Collaboration Boundaries.

---

### 5. CLI

**Owns:** `legged_gym/cli/rugiar.py` (~617 lines) — argument parsing and pure forwarding for four subcommands: `train`, `order`, `fuse`, `distill`, plus read-only discovery flags (`--list_tasks`, `--list_policies`, `--list_reward_scales`, `--list_fusion_methods`, `--list_distill_methods`).

**Entry points:** the `rugiar` executable itself. Every subcommand does argv→kwargs mapping into one `TrainingManager` call, then (for `train`/`distill`) blocks on `poll()` in-process, printing live log/progress, and calls `finalize_policy()` on success itself — the CLI is its own driver loop for job completion, separate from `rugiar_driver.py`'s.

**Talks to:**
- **Training / Policy Operations** only — `TrainingManager.start()`, `.start_distillation()`, `.fuse_policies()`, `.get_policy_order()`/`.set_policy_order()`. Zero logic duplicated; every call forwards its full kwargs.
- **Confirmed zero contact with Control or Robot Driver.** No import of `SimAdapter`, `PolicySupervisor`, `SafetyGovernor`, `ControlService`, or `RealAdapter` anywhere in `rugiar.py`. The one `legged_gym.envs` import exists solely to populate `task_registry` as an import side effect (needed even for `--list_tasks`), not to build any simulator or environment.

This is the cleanest boundary in the repo and worth preserving deliberately: if a future change makes the CLI reach into Control or the driver, that is a boundary violation worth pushing back on in review.

---

### 6. Robot Driver

**Owns:** `legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py` (ordinary walking tasks, g1 family) and `legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver_target.py` (target-aware tasks, g1_target family) — two independent scripts, not modes of one script, because Genesis cannot rebuild its scene in-process; switching task families spawns a fresh driver process (~15-20s startup).

**Entry points:** `python rugiar_driver.py [--real] [--control_port ...] [--policy ...]` — builds the simulator (or `RealAdapter`), the `ControlService`/`ControlServer` stack, loads policies (explicit `--policy` flags plus auto-discovery from `policies/<name>/`), and runs the main loop: drain web commands → policy tick → render/publish, at a configurable playback speed.

**Talks to:**
- **Control** — instantiates and owns every Control class (`ControlService`, `ControlServer`, `SimAdapter`/`RealAdapter`, `PolicySupervisor`, `SafetyGovernor`) directly; this is where Control's pieces actually get wired together and ticked.
- **Training** — calls `TrainingManager.start()`, `.poll()`, `.finalize_policy()` on the sim thread each tick (`drain_finished_training`), then hot-loads the result via `PolicySupervisor.add_policy()`. Never calls `fuse_policies` or `start_distillation` directly.
- **Web UI** — indirectly, as the process hosting `ControlServer`'s WebSocket/HTTP endpoints the UI connects to.

**Duplication note:** the two driver scripts are guarded against silent divergence by `test_driver_family_parity.py`, which AST-parses and enforces text-identical bodies for 8 helpers that are not supposed to be target-specific. Target-only logic (e.g. `_inject_target_obs()`) is deliberately excluded from that check.

**Real-hardware caveat:** several correctness properties (motor wiring order, IMU mount/quaternion convention, checkpoint-vs-robot-config scale match) can only be verified by a human with the physical robot; the driver's pre-flight check fails loudly on detectable mismatches but cannot catch all of them statically.

---

### 7. Third-Party Integrations (placeholder)

No code exists in this repo for this area yet, but there's real upstream work to integrate against, in a separate repository — most likely as a new data source or panel surfaced through the Web UI once it lands:

- **Motion capture → G1 retargeting pipeline.** Markerless motion capture and monocular video2robot extraction, retargeted to G1 joint angles, with PPO-trained RL tracking policies per motion (ONNX-exportable, hardware-deployable). Released dataset: [exptech/g1-moves on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/exptech/g1-moves) — 60 clips (~30 min, dance/karate/bonus), CC-BY-4.0, multiple pipeline stages (raw mocap BVH/FBX, retargeted PKL/CSV, training-ready NPZ, trained PyTorch/ONNX policies). A prebuilt release lives at [jvillalba007/GIAR-moves](https://github.com/jvillalba007/GIAR-moves/releases/tag/1.0.0).
- **[Motion Viewer](https://giar-mv.9zteam.pp.ua/)** — a standalone, browser-based (WebGL/Three.js) tool for previewing this motion data: drag in a URDF/MJCF + meshes, drag in an `.npz`/`.pkl` motion, get playback with scrubbing, speed control, and trajectory trails. No install, no upload — runs entirely client-side. Useful today for eyeballing a motion clip before deciding whether it's worth retargeting into a RUgiar training run.
- **[unitreerobotics](https://github.com/unitreerobotics)** (official) — the broader ecosystem this integration will likely draw from: `unitree_rl_lab`/`unitree_rl_mjlab` (IsaacLab/MuJoCo RL frameworks with G1 mimic-task support — directly relevant to importing motion-tracking policies), `unitree_lerobot` (end-to-end embodied AI, data conversion + policy training + real-world deployment), `xr_teleoperate` (XR teleoperation with data recording — an alternative motion-data source).

The concrete integration contract (how a `g1-moves`-style motion/policy gets pulled into RUgiar's own `policies/<name>/` catalog, and whether it's a `rugiar distill`-style behavior clone or a new dedicated pipeline) isn't decided yet — treat this area as reserved/unclaimed until that's settled, and check in with whoever's driving the motion-capture side before assuming an integration point. More papers/sources may get added here as that work matures.

## Collaboration Boundaries

Files below are grouped by area. "Collision risk" flags concurrency invariants, oversized files, or files more than one area reaches into — the places SOLID's Single-Responsibility and Dependency-Inversion principles most directly pay off here: each area should depend on the *interface* another area exposes (RPC methods, `TrainingManager` public methods, the `RobotAdapter` protocol) rather than reaching into its internals.

**Training** — `legged_gym/control/training.py`, `legged_gym/scripts/web_train.py`, `legged_gym/scripts/web_distill.py`, `legged_gym/control/kaggle_backend.py`.
- Risk: `training.py` is ~1520 lines mixing six concerns (job lifecycle, policy catalog, log parsing, system profiling, fusion/distillation orchestration, Kaggle integration) — the single largest merge-conflict surface in the repo. A Single-Responsibility split (job lifecycle / policy catalog / estimation, as three modules) would materially reduce collisions before more collaborators land here.
- Risk: `poll()` is documented as **not thread-safe** — it assumes a single-threaded caller (the driver's sim thread or the CLI's own loop). Do not call it from more than one thread without adding locking.
- Contract risk: `result.json` / `progress.json` schemas are informally documented only in `training.py`'s comments, not in `web_train.py`/`web_distill.py` themselves — changing those scripts' output format can silently break polling.

**Policy Operations** — `legged_gym/control/fusion.py`, `legged_gym/control/distillation.py`. Orchestration code (`fuse_policies()`, `start_distillation()`) lives inside `training.py`, so a change here often means touching that file too — coordinate with whoever owns Training work in flight.
- Risk: no isolated ownership of the orchestration path; a Dependency-Inversion cleanup (algorithms depend on a narrow job-lifecycle interface, not directly embedded in `TrainingManager`) would let this area evolve independently of Training's own refactors.

**Control** — `legged_gym/control/service.py`, `transport.py`, `supervisor.py`, `safety.py`, `selector.py`, `adapter.py`, `policy.py`, `deploy/real_adapter.py`, plus `examples/joystick_controller.py` as the reference external client for the WebSocket protocol.
- Hard invariant: every `ControlService` call except `request_switch`/`pause`/`resume`/`estop` must go through `ControlServer`'s command queue, drained once per sim tick. Adding a new "direct-call" shortcut without re-verifying it's a cheap flag-set (<1ms, no per-tick state) is the most likely way to introduce a race.
- Risk: `PolicySupervisor.request_switch()` is idempotent by pending-name (second caller in the same tick gets `False`) — human and autonomous `Selector` requests can legitimately race here; this is handled, not a bug, but easy to "fix" incorrectly.
- Risk: policy deletion currently writes directly to disk from more than one place; Training and Control both touch `policies/<name>/`. Longer-term this should be Training's exclusive responsibility (Dependency Inversion: Control should ask Training to delete, not do it itself).

**Web UI** — `web/index.html`, `web/app.js`.
- Highest risk in the repo for parallel work: no module boundaries, ~50 module-scope globals (`cruiseVx/Vy/Yaw`, `keymap`, `policyListExpanded`, `selectedChartKeys`, `trainingCatalog`, …), no panel registry, no per-panel render function convention. Two people adding panels today will very likely collide on global names or both hook into `applyStatus()` in conflicting ways.
- Before adding a panel: check whether your state can live in a panel-local closure instead of a new module global, and prefer adding to (not duplicating) the existing `makeSortable()` drag abstraction rather than copy-pasting its storage/restore pattern.

**CLI** — `legged_gym/cli/rugiar.py`.
- Low risk by design: every subcommand is pure argv→kwargs forwarding into `TrainingManager`, with zero logic duplicated elsewhere. The valuable thing to protect here is the *absence* of imports from Control/Robot Driver — treat any PR that adds one as a boundary violation to question.

**Robot Driver** — `legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py`, `legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver_target.py`, `legged_gym/scripts/test_driver_family_parity.py`.
- Risk: the two driver scripts are intentionally duplicated (Genesis can't rebuild its scene in-process), guarded only by an AST-based parity test over 8 specific helpers. Changing a helper's signature or behavior in one driver without updating the other, or without checking whether the parity test's helper list still applies, will pass review-by-eye but fail CI.
- Risk: training jobs are orphaned as background subprocesses if a family switch relaunches the driver process mid-run — no persistent daemon exists yet to survive that.

**Third-Party Integrations** — no files yet. When this lands, expect it to add files under `web/` (per the stated integration point) plus possibly a new area-owned module elsewhere; until then there is nothing to collide with, but also nothing to build against — confirm the actual integration contract with that collaborator before writing code that assumes one.
