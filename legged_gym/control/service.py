"""
ControlService — the one call surface. A viser button callback calls
`service.request_switch("cautious")`. An autonomous Selector loop calls the
exact same method. A future WebSocket/HTTP bridge for controlling a real,
UI-less robot from an external web app would also just call this method —
it would be a thin transport wrapper around this class, not a parallel
implementation.

Today this class is used in-process (see legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py):
viser's GUI callbacks call straight into it, no network hop needed for a
local sim demo. The moment you want to drive this from a *different*
process or machine (a real robot with no local display, an external web
app), wrap this same class with a tiny JSON-RPC-ish layer over WebSocket —
switch/status/pause/estop is the whole surface, per the architecture
write-up in the README.
